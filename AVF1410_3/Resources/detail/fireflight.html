		<dd> It’s difficult to ignore the truth in such timeless adages, wisdom that often bears repeating, especially for those in the midst of that “season,” “dark hour,” or “time of waiting.”  Such is the case with GRAMMY Award nominated, female-fronted rock act Fireflight, whose preceding 2010 album, For Those Who Wait, left listeners patiently anticipating the band’s next move. 

Fireflight, too, awaited its new direction.  The group’s third studio project laid bare its vulnerability, with songs echoing a cry for divine comfort, guidance, and understanding. As the title suggests, members Dawn Michele (lead vocals), Justin Cox (guitar, keys, vocals), Wendy Drennen (bass, vocals), Glenn Drennen (guitar), and Adam McMillion (drums) were in a holding pattern, a season of uncertainty, trusting God to make known His plan and purpose.

“At that time, we had been through a lot of hurt and disappointment,” says Dawn.  “Although we knew that God was shaping our character through life’s unexpected twists and turns, we didn’t know how or where to go from there.”

It was in the waiting; however, when God seemed silent, that He began stirring a call to action, one that would serve as the heart of Fireflight’s fourth record, NOW.</dd>
