		<dd>Derek “Chap Stique” Mount recalls a conversation he had a few years ago with Jerome Olds, the patriarch of the family whose sons started Family Force 5 over a decade ago. “At one point he said to me, ‘Hey man, you know what’s wrong with you guys? When you first came out, you were reckless. You’re not reckless anymore,’” recalls the guitarist. “And on this album, we wanted to capture that recklessness again. Just hit ‘record’ and see what happens.”</dd>
